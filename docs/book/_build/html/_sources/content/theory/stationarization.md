# Stationarization

The previous chapters derive all the equations necessary to solve for the steady-state and nonsteady-state equilibria of this model. However, because labor productivity is growing at rate $g_y$ as can be seen in the firms' production function {eq}`EqFirmsCESprodfun` and the population is growing at rate $\tilde{g}_{n,t}$ as defined in {eq}`EqPopGrowthTil`, the model is not stationary. Different endogenous variables of the model are growing at different rates. We have already specified three potential budget closure rules {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_Gt`, {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_TRt`, and {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_TRGt` using some combination of government spending $G_t$ and transfers $TR_t$ that stationarize the debt-to-GDP ratio.

{numref}`TabStnrzStatVars` lists the definitions of stationary versions of all the endogenous variables. Variables with a ``$\:\,\hat{}\,\:$'' signify stationary variables. The first column of variables are growing at the productivity growth rate $g_y$. These variables are most closely associated with individual variables. The second column of variables are growing at the population growth rate $\tilde{g}_{n,t}$. These variables are most closely associated with population values. The third column of variables are growing at both the productivity growth rate $g_y$ and the population growth rate $\tilde{g}_{n,t}$. These variables are most closely associated with aggregate variables. The last column shows that the interest rates $r_t$, $r_{p,t}$ and $r_{gov,t}$, and household labor supply $n_{j,s,t}$ are already stationary.


```{list-table} **Stationary variable definitions.** Note: The interest rate $r_t$ in firm first order condition is already stationary because $Y_{m,t}$ and $K_{m,t}$ grow at the same rate and $p_{m,t}$ is stationary. Household labor supply $n_{j,s,t}\in[0,\tilde{l}]$ is stationary.

The usual definition of equilibrium would be allocations and prices such that households optimize {eq}`EqHH_ciDem2`, {eq}`EqHHeul_n`, {eq}`EqHHeul_b`, and {eq}`EqHHeul_bS`, firms optimize {eq}`EqFirmFOC_L` and {eq}`EqFirmFOC_K`, and markets clear {eq}`EqMarkClrLab`, {eq}`EqMarkClr_DtDdDf`, {eq}`EqMarkClr_KtKdKf`, {eq}`EqMarkClrGoods_Mm1`, {eq}`EqMarkClrGoods_M`, and {eq}`EqMarkClrBQ`. In this chapter, we show how to stationarize each of these characterizing equations so that we can use our fixed point methods described in Sections {ref}`SecEqlbSSsoln` and {ref}`SecEqlbNSSsoln` of Chapter {ref}`Chap_Eqm` to solve for the equilibria in the steady-state and transition path equilibrium definitions.

## Stationarized Household Equations

  The stationary versions of the household industry-specific goods preferences and demand equations are obtained by dividing both sides of the equations by the productivity growth rate $e^{g_y t}$,

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzCompCons
    \hat{c}_{j,s,t} \equiv \prod_{i=1}^I \left(\hat{c}_{i,j,s,t} - \hat{c}_{min,i,t}\right)^{\alpha_i} \quad\forall j,s,t \quad\text{with}\quad \sum_{i=1}^I\alpha_i=1
  ```
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_cmDem2
    \hat{c}_{i,j,s,t} = \alpha_i\left(\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_t}\right)^{-1}\hat{c}_{j,s,t} + \hat{c}_{min,i,t} \quad\forall i,j,s,t
  ```
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_cmin
    \hat{c}_{min,i,t} \equiv
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{c_{min,i}}{e^{g_y t}} \quad\text{for}\quad t < T \\
      \frac{c_{min,i}}{e^{g_y T}} \quad\text{for}\quad t \geq T
    \end{cases} \quad\forall i
  ```

  where {eq}`EqStnrzCompCons` is the stationarized Stone-Geary consumption aggregator for composite consumption and  {eq}`EqStnrz_cmDem2` is the stationarized household demand for the composite consumption good. The composite price aggregation equation {eq}`EqCompPnorm2` is already stationary.

  Note that the only way to stationarize the consumption aggregator {eq}`EqStnrzCompCons` and consumption demand {eq}`EqStnrz_cmDem2` is to divide $c_{min,i}$ by the growth rate $e^{g_y t}$. However, $c_{min,i}$ is already stationary. It is constant for each $m$. Therefore, the version of $\hat{c}_{min,i,t}$ divided by $e^{g_y t}$ would be changing over time (nonstationary) for $g_y\neq 0$. For this reason, we define $\hat{c}_{min,i,t}$ in {eq}`EqStnrz_cmin` as being constant after the steady-state period $T$ at whatever value it reaches at that period. In most cases with $g_y>0$, that value will be close to zero. But we use $\bar{c}_{min,i} = c_{min,i}/e^{g_y T}$ from {eq}`EqStnrz_cmin` as the steady-state value of $c_{min,i}$.

  The stationary version of the household budget constraint {eq}`EqHHBC` is found by dividing both sides of the equation by $e^{g_y t}$. For the savings term $b_{j,s+1,t+1}$, we must also multiply by $e^{g_y(t+1)}$, which leaves an $e^{g_y} = \frac{e^{g_y(t+1)}}{e^{g_y t}}$ in front of the stationarized variable.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzHHBC
    p_t\hat{c}_{j,s,t} + &\sum_{i=1}^I (1 + \tau^{c}_{i,t})p_{i,t}\hat{c}_{min,i} + e^{g_y}\hat{b}_{j,s+1,t+1} = \\
    &(1 + r_{p,t})\hat{b}_{j,s,t} + \hat{w}_t e_{j,s} n_{j,s,t} + \\
    &\quad\quad\zeta_{j,s}\frac{\hat{BQ}_t}{\lambda_j\hat{\omega}_{s,t}} + \eta_{j,s,t}\frac{\hat{TR}_{t}}{\lambda_j\hat{\omega}_{s,t}} + \hat{ubi}_{j,s,t} - \hat{T}_{j,s,t}  \\
    &\quad\forall j,t\quad\text{and}\quad s\geq E+1 \quad\text{where}\quad \hat{b}_{j,E+1,t}=0\quad\forall j,t
  ```

  Because total bequests $BQ_t$ and total government transfers $TR_t$ grow at both the labor productivity growth rate and the population growth rate, we have to multiply and divide each of those terms by the economically relevant population $\tilde{N}_t$. This stationarizes total bequests $\hat{BQ}_t$, total transfers $\hat{TR}_t$, and the respective population level in the denominator $\hat{\omega}_{s,t}$.

  We stationarize the Euler equations for labor supply {eq}`EqHHeul_n` by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y(1-\sigma)}$. On the left-hand-side, $e^{g_y}$ stationarizes the wage $\hat{w}_t$ and $e^{-\sigma g_y}$ goes inside the parentheses and stationarizes consumption $\hat{c}_{j,s,t}$. On the right-and-side, the $e^{g_y(1-\sigma)}$ terms cancel out.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_eul_n
    &\frac{\hat{w}_t e_{j,s}}{p_t}\bigl(1 - \tau^{mtrx}_{s,t}\bigr)(\hat{c}_{j,s,t})^{-\sigma} = \chi^n_{s}\biggl(\frac{b}{\tilde{l}}\biggr)\biggl(\frac{n_{j,s,t}}{\tilde{l}}\biggr)^{\upsilon-1}\Biggl[1 - \biggl(\frac{n_{j,s,t}}{\tilde{l}}\biggr)^\upsilon\Biggr]^{\frac{1-\upsilon}{\upsilon}} \\
    &\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\forall j,t, \quad\text{and}\quad E+1\leq s\leq E+S \\
  ```

  We stationarize the Euler equations for savings {eq}`EqHHeul_b` and {eq}`EqHHeul_bS` by dividing both sides of the respective equations by $e^{-\sigma g_y t}$. On the right-hand-side of the equation, we then need to multiply and divide both terms by $e^{-\sigma g_y(t+1)}$, which leaves a multiplicative coefficient $e^{-\sigma g_y}$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_eul_b
    \frac{(\hat{c}_{j,s,t})^{-\sigma}}{p_t} &= e^{-\sigma g_y}\Biggl[\chi^b_j\rho_s(\hat{b}_{j,s+1,t+1})^{-\sigma} + \\
    &\qquad\qquad\quad \beta_j\bigl(1 - \rho_s\bigr)\left(\frac{1 + r_{p,t+1}\bigl[1 - \tau^{mtry}_{s+1,t+1}\bigr]}{p_{t+1}}\right)(\hat{c}_{j,s+1,t+1})^{-\sigma}\Biggr] \\
    &\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\forall j,t, \quad\text{and}\quad E+1\leq s\leq E+S-1 \\
  ```

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_eul_bS
    \frac{(\hat{c}_{j,E+S,t})^{-\sigma}}{p_t} = e^{-\sigma g_y}\chi^b_j(\hat{b}_{j,E+S+1,t+1})^{-\sigma} \quad\forall j,t \quad\text{and}\quad s = E+S
  ```

## Stationarized Firms Equations

  The nonstationary production function {eq}`EqFirmsCESprodfun` for each industry can be stationarized by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}$. This stationarizes output $\hat{Y}_{m,t}$ on the left-hand-side. Because the general CES production function is homogeneous of degree 1, $F(xK,xK_g,xL) = xF(K,K_g,L)$, the right-hand-side of the production function is also stationarized by dividing by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzCESprodfun
    \begin{split}
      \hat{Y}_{m,t} &= F(\hat{K}_{m,t}, \hat{K}_{g,m,t}, \hat{L}_{m,t}) \\
      &\equiv Z_{m,t}\biggl[(\gamma_m)^\frac{1}{\varepsilon_m}(\hat{K}_{m,t})^\frac{\varepsilon_m-1}{\varepsilon_m} + (\gamma_{g,m})^\frac{1}{\varepsilon_m}(\hat{K}_{g,m,t})^\frac{\varepsilon_m-1}{\varepsilon_m} + ... \\
      &\qquad\qquad\qquad (1-\gamma_m-\gamma_{g,m})^\frac{1}{\varepsilon_m}(\hat{L}_{m,t})^\frac{\varepsilon_m-1}{\varepsilon_m}\biggr]^\frac{\varepsilon_m}{\varepsilon_m-1} \quad\forall m,t
    \end{split}
  ```

  Notice that the growth term multiplied by the labor input drops out in this stationarized version of the production function. We stationarize the nonstationary profit function {eq}`EqFirmsProfit` in the same way, by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzProfit
    \hat{PR}_{m,t} &= (1 - \tau^{corp}_{m,t})\Bigl[F(\hat{K}_{m,t},\hat{K}_{g,m,t},\hat{L}_{m,t}) - \hat{w}_t \hat{L}_{m,t}\Bigr] - ... \\
    &\qquad\qquad\quad \bigl(r_t + \delta_{M,t}\bigr)\hat{K}_{m,t} + \tau^{corp}_{m,t}\delta^\tau_{m,t}\hat{K}_{m,t} + \tau^{inv}_{m,t}\delta_{M,t}\hat{K}_{m,t} \quad\forall m,t
  ```

  The firms' first order equation for labor demand {eq}`EqFirmFOC_L` is stationarized by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}$. This stationarizes the wage $\hat{w}_t$ on the left-hand-side and cancels out the $e^{g_y t}$ term in front of the right-hand-side. To complete the stationarization, we multiply and divide the $\frac{Y_{m,t}}{e^{g_y t}L_{m,t}}$ term on the right-hand-side by $\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzFOC_L
    \hat{w}_t = p_{m,t}(Z_{m,t})^\frac{\varepsilon_m-1}{\varepsilon_m}\left[(1-\gamma_m-\gamma_{g,m})\frac{\hat{Y}_{m,t}}{\hat{L}_{m,t}}\right]^\frac{1}{\varepsilon_m} \quad\forall m,t
  ```

  It can be seen from the firms' first order equation for capital demand {eq}`EqFirmFOC_K` that the interest rate is already stationary. If we multiply and divide the $\frac{Y_{m,t}}{K_{m,t}}$ term on the right-hand-side by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$, those two aggregate variables become stationary. In other words, $Y_{m,t}$ and $K_{m,t}$ grow at the same rate and $\frac{Y_{m,t}}{K_{m,t}} = \frac{\hat{Y}_{m,t}}{\hat{K}_{m,t}}$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzFOC_K
    r_t = (1 - \tau^{corp}_{m,t})p_{m,t}(Z_{m,t})^\frac{\varepsilon_m-1}{\varepsilon_m}\left[\gamma_m\frac{\hat{Y}_{m,t}}{\hat{K}_{m,t}}\right]^\frac{1}{\varepsilon_m} - \delta_{M,t} + \tau^{corp}_{m,t}\delta^\tau_{m,t} + \tau^{inv}_{m,t}\delta_{M,t} \quad\forall m,t
  ```

  A stationary version of the firms' gross revenue attributed to each factor of production {eq}`EqFirmsMargRevEq` is found by dividing both sides of the equation by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzMargRevEq
    \hat{Y}_{m,t} = MPK_{m,t}\hat{K}_{m,t} + MPK_{g,m,t}\hat{K}_{g,m,t} + \hat{MPL}_{m,t}\hat{L}_{m,t} \quad\forall m,t
  ```

  Note that this implies that both the marginal product of private capital $MPK_{m,t}$ and the marginal product of public capital $MPK_{g,m,t}$ are already stationary, as seen in {eq}`EqFirmsMPK_opt` and {eq}`EqFirmsMPKg_opt`. However, we see in {eq}`EqFirmsMPL_opt` that the marginal product of labor is growing at rate $e^{g_y t}$ because of its relationship to the wage $w_t$. The division of both sides of {eq}`EqFirmsMargRevEq` by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$ gives us a stationarized marginal product of labor $\hat{MPL}_{m,t}$ and a stationarized labor demand $\hat{L}_{m,t}$.

  Using the derivation of firm profits when firms are optimizing in {eq}`EqFirmsProfit_Kg` and the expressions for optimized stationary revenue {eq}`EqStnrzMargRevEq`, we can show the stationary equation for firm profits when firms are optimizing. As before, stationary profits are positive when stationary public capital is positive $\hat{K}_{g,m,t}>0$.
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzProfit_Kg
    \hat{PR}_{m,t} = (1 - \tau^{corp}_{m,t})p_{m,t}MPK_{g,m,t}\hat{K}_{g,m,t} \quad\forall m,t
  ```

  Using the derivation from {eq}`EqFirmsPayout` and {eq}`EqFirms_rKt` in Chapter {ref}`Chap_Firms`, we can stationarize the terms in the right-hand-side of the expression for $r_{K,t}$ by multiplying and dividing the quotient in the last term by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$. This implies that the interest rate paid out by the financial intermediary on private capital $r_{K,t}$ is stationary, whether the variables on the right-hand-side are non-stationary in {eq}`EqFirms_rKt` or stationarized as in {eq}`EqStnrz_rKt`.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_rKt
    r_{K,t} =  r_t + \frac{\sum_{m=1}^M(1 - \tau^{corp}_{m,t})p_{m,t}MPK_{g,m,t}\hat{K}_{g,m,t}}{\sum_{m=1}^M\hat{K}_{m,t}} \quad\forall t
  ```

## Stationarized Government Equations

  Each of the tax rate functions $\tau^{etr}_{s,t}$, $\tau^{mtrx}_{s,t}$, and $\tau^{mtry}_{s,t}$ is stationary. The total tax liability function $T_{j,s,t}$ is growing at the rate of labor productivity growth $g_y$ This can be see by looking at the decomposition of the total tax liability function into the effective tax rate times total income {eq}`EqTaxCalcLiabETR`. The effective tax rate function is stationary, and household income is growing at rate $g_y$. So household total tax liability is stationarized by dividing both sides of the equation by $e^{g_y t}$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzLiabETR
    \hat{T}_{js,t} &= \tau^{etr}_{s,t}(\hat{x}_{j,s,t}, \hat{y}_{j,s,t})\left(\hat{x}_{j,s,t} + \hat{y}_{j,s,t}\right) \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\:\:\:\forall j,t \quad\text{and}\quad s\geq E+1 \\
    &= \tau^{etr}_{s,t}(\hat{w}_t e_{j,s}n_{j,s,t}, r_{p,t}\hat{b}_{j,s,t})\left(\hat{w}_t e_{j,s}n_{j,s,t} + r_{p,t}\hat{b}_{j,s,t}\right) \quad\forall j,t \quad\text{and}\quad s\geq E+1
  ```

  We can stationarize the simple expressions for total government spending on household transfers $TR_t$ in {eq}`EqUnbalGBCtfer` and on public goods $G_t$ in {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_Gt` by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$,

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzNomGDP
    p_t \hat{Y}_t \equiv \sum_{m=1}^M p_{m,t} \hat{Y}_{m,t} \quad\forall t
  ```

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzTfer
    \hat{TR}_t = g_{tr,t}\:\alpha_{tr}\: p_t \hat{Y}_t \quad\forall t
  ```

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_Gt
    \hat{G}_t = g_{g,t}\:\alpha_{g}\: p_t \hat{Y}_t \quad\forall t
  ```

  where the time varying multipliers $g_{g,t}$ and $g_{tr,t}$, respectively, are defined in {eq}`EqStnrzClosureRule_Gt` and {eq}`EqStnrzClosureRule_TRt` below. These multipliers $g_{g,t}$ and $g_{tr,t}$ do not have a ``$\:\,\hat{}\,\:$'' on them because their specifications {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_Gt` and {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_TRt` that are functions of nonstationary variables are equivalent to {eq}`EqStnrzClosureRule_Gt` and {eq}`EqStnrzClosureRule_TRt` specified in stationary variables.

  We can stationarize the expression for total government revenue $Rev_t$ in {eq}`EqUnbalGBCgovRev` by dividing both sides of the equation by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzGovRev
    \hat{Rev}_t &= \underbrace{\sum_{m=1}^M\Bigl[\tau^{corp}_{m,t}\bigl(p_{m,t}\hat{Y}_{m,t} - \hat{w}_t\hat{L}_t\bigr) - \tau^{corp}_{m,t}\delta^\tau_{m,t}\hat{K}_{m,t} - \tau^{inv}_{m,t}\hat{I}_{m,t}\Bigr]}_{\text{corporate tax revenue}} \\
    &\qquad + \underbrace{\sum_{s=E+1}^{E+S}\sum_{j=1}^J\lambda_j\hat{\omega}_{s,t}\tau^{etr}_{s,t}\left(\hat{x}_{j,s,t},\hat{y}_{j,s,t}\right)\bigl(\hat{x}_{j,s,t} + \hat{y}_{j,s,t}\bigr)}_{\text{household tax revenue}} \quad\forall t
  ```

  Every term in the government budget constraint {eq}`EqUnbalGBCbudgConstr` is growing at both the productivity growth rate and the population growth rate, so we stationarize it by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$. We also have to multiply and divide the next period debt term $D_{t+1}$ by $e^{g_y(t+1)}\tilde{N}_{t+1}$, leaving the term $e^{g_y}(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1})$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzGovBC
    e^{g_y}\left(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\right)\hat{D}_{t+1} + \hat{Rev}_t = (1 + r_{gov,t})\hat{D}_t + \hat{G}_t + \hat{I}_{g,t} + \hat{TR}_t + \hat{UBI}_t \quad\forall t

  The stationarized versions of the rule for total government infrastructure investment spending $I_{g,t}$ in {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_Igt` and the rule for government investment spending in each industry in {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_Igt` are found by dividing both sides of the respective equations by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.
  ```{math}

    \hat{I}_{g,t} = \alpha_{I,t}\: p_t\hat{Y}_t \quad\forall t

  The stationarized version of the law of motion for the public capital stock in each industry $K_{g,m,t}$ in {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_Kgmt` is found by dividing both sides of the equation by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$ then multiply and divide the $K_{g,m,t+1}$ term on the left-hand-side by $e^{g_y(t+1)}\tilde{N}_{t+1}$, leaving the term $e^{g_y}(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1})$ in the denominator of the right-hand-side.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_Kgmt
    \hat{K}_{g,m,t+1} = \frac{(1 - \delta_g)\hat{K}_{g,m,t} + \hat{I}_{g,m,t}}{e^{g_y}(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1})}  \quad\forall m,t
  ```

  Stationary aggregate universal basic income expenditure is found in one of two ways depending on how the individual UBI payments $ubi_{j,s,t}$ are modeled. In Section {ref}`SecUBI` of Chapter {ref}`Chap_UnbalGBC`, we discuss how UBI payments to households $ubi_{j,s,t}$ can be growth adjusted so that they grow over time at the rate of productivity growth or non-growth adjusted such that they are constant overtime. In the first case, when UBI benefits are growth adjusted and growing over time, the stationary aggregate government UBI payout $\hat{UBI}_t$ is found by dividing {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_UBI` by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$. In the second case, when UBI benefits are constant over time and not growing with productivity, the stationary aggregate government UBI payout $\hat{UBI}_t$ is found by dividing {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_UBI` by only $\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzGBC_UBI
    \hat{UBI}_t =
      \begin{cases}
        \sum_{s=E+1}^{E+S}\sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j\hat{\omega}_{s,t} \hat{ubi}_{j,s,t} \quad\forall t \quad\text{if}\quad ubi_{j,s,t} \:\:\text{is growth adjusted} \\
        \sum_{s=E+1}^{E+S}\sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j\hat{\omega}_{s,t} ubi_{j,s,t} \quad\forall t \quad\text{if}\quad ubi_{j,s,t} \:\:\text{is not growth adjusted}
      \end{cases}
  ```

  The expression for the interest rate on government debt $r_{gov,t}$ in {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_rate_wedge` is already stationary because every term on the right-hand-side is already stationary. The net return on capital, $r_{K,t}$ is also stationary as shown in {eq}`EqStnrz_rKt`. The expression for the return to household savings $r_{p,t}$ in {eq}`eq_portfolio_return` is equivalent to its stationary representation because the same macroeconomic variables occur linearly in both the numerator and denominator.

  ```{math}
    :label: EqStnrz_rate_p

  ```

  The long-run debt-to-GDP ratio condition is also the same in both the nonstationary version in {eq}`EqUnbalGBC_DY` as well as the stationary version below because the endogenous side is a ratio of macroeconomic variables that are growing at the same rate, with the exception of already stationary $p_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_DY
    \frac{\hat{D}_t}{p_t\hat{Y}_t} = \alpha_D \quad\text{for}\quad t\geq T
  ```

  The three potential budget closure rules {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_Gt`, {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_TRt`, and {eq}`EqUnbalGBCclosure_TRGt` are the last government equations to stationarize. In each of the cases, we simply divide both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.

## Stationarized Market Clearing Equations

  The labor market clearing equation {eq}`EqMarkClrLab` is stationarized by dividing both sides by $\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzMarkClrLab
    \sum_{m=1}^M \hat{L}_{m,t} = \sum_{s=E+1}^{E+S}\sum_{j=1}^{J} \hat{\omega}_{s,t}\lambda_j e_{j,s}n_{j,s,t} \quad \forall t
  ```

  Total savings by domestic households $B_t$ from {eq}`EqMarkClr_Bt` is stationarized by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$. The $\omega_{s,t-1}$ terms on the right-hand_side require multiplying and dividing by $\tilde{N}_{t-1}$, which leads to the division of $1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t}$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_Bt
    \hat{B}_t \equiv \frac{1}{1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t}}\sum_{s=E+2}^{E+S+1}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\Bigl(\hat{\omega}_{s-1,t-1}\lambda_j b_{j,s,t} + i_s\hat{\omega}_{s,t-1}\lambda_j \hat{b}_{j,s,t}\Bigr) \quad \forall t
  ```

  And the total domestic savings constraint {eq}`EqMarkClr_DomCapCnstr` is stationarized by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_DomCapCnstr
    \hat{K}^d_t + \hat{D}^d_t = \hat{B}_t \quad \forall t
  ```

  The stationarized law of motion for foreign holdings of government debt {eq}`EqMarkClr_zetaD` and the government debt market clearing condition {eq}`EqMarkClr_DtDdDf`, respectively, are solved for by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_zetaD
    e^{g_y}\bigl[1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr]\hat{D}^{f}_{t+1} = \hat{D}^{f}_{t} + \zeta_{D}\Bigl(e^{g_y}\bigl[1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr]\hat{D}_{t+1} - \hat{D}_{t}\Bigr) \quad\forall t
  ```

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_DtDdDf
    \hat{D}_t = \hat{D}^d_t + \hat{D}^f_t \quad\forall t
  ```

  The private capital market clearing equation {eq}`EqMarkClr_KtKdKf` is stationarized by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$, as is the expression for excess demand at the world interest rate {eq}`EqMarkClr_ExDemK` and the exogenous expression for foreign private capital flows {eq}`EqMarkClr_zetaK`.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_KtKdKf
    \hat{K}_t = \hat{K}^d_t + \hat{K}^f_t \quad\forall t \quad\text{where}\quad \hat{K_t} \equiv \sum_{m=1}^M \hat{K}_{m,t}
  ```

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_ExDemK
    \hat{ED}^{K,r^*}_t \equiv \hat{K}^{r^*}_t - \hat{K}^d_t \quad\forall t \quad\text{where}\quad \hat{K}^{r^*}_t \equiv \sum_{m=1}^M \hat{K}^{r^*}_{m,t}
  ```

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrz_zetaK
    \hat{K}^{f}_t = \zeta_{K}\hat{ED}^{K,r^*}_t \quad\forall t
  ```

  We stationarize the goods market clearing equations for the first $M-1$ industries {eq}`EqMarkClrGoods_Mm1` and for the $M$th industry {eq}`EqMarkClrGoods_M` by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$. On the right-hand-side, we must multiply and divide the $K^d_{t+1}$ term and the $D^f_{t+1}$ term, respectively, by $e^{g_y(t+1)}\tilde{N}_{t+1}$ leaving the coefficient $e^{g_y}(1+\tilde{g}_{n,t+1})$.
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzMarkClrGoods_Mm1
    \hat{Y}_{m,t} = \hat{C}_{m,t} \quad\forall t \quad\text{and}\quad m=1,2,...M-1
  ```
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzMarkClrGoods_M
    \hat{Y}_{M,t} &= \hat{C}_{M,t} + \hat{I}_{M,t} + \hat{I}_{g,t} + \hat{G}_t + r_{p,t} \hat{K}^f_t + r_{p,t}\hat{D}^f_t ... \\
    &\quad - \Bigl(e^{g_y}\bigl[1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr]\hat{K}^f_{t+1} - \hat{K}^f_t\Bigr) - \Bigl(e^{g_y}\bigl[1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr]\hat{D}^f_{t+1} - \hat{D}^f_t\Bigr) \quad\forall t
  ```
  where
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzEqCmt
    \hat{C}_{m,t} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{s=E+1}^{E+S}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\hat{\omega}_{s,t}\lambda_j \pi_{i,m} \hat{c}_{i,j,s,t} \quad\forall m,t
  ```
  and
  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzMarkClrGoods_IMt
    \hat{I}_{M,t} &\equiv e^{g_y}\bigl(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr)\sum_{m=1}^M \hat{K}_{m,t+1} - (1 - \delta_{M,t})\sum_{m=1}^M \hat{K}_{m,t} \quad\forall t \\
    &= e^{g_y}\bigl(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr)\hat{K}_{t+1} - (1 - \delta_{M,t})\hat{K}_t \\
    &= e^{g_y}\bigl(1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t+1}\bigr)(\hat{K}^d_{t+1} + \hat{K}^f_{t+1}) - (1 - \delta_{M,t})(\hat{K}^d_t + \hat{K}^f_t)
  ```

  We stationarize the law of motion for total bequests $BQ_t$ in {eq}`EqMarkClrBQ` by dividing both sides by $e^{g_y t}\tilde{N}_t$. Because the population levels in the summation are from period $t-1$, we must multiply and divide the summed term by $\tilde{N}_{t-1}$ leaving the term in the denominator of $1+\tilde{g}_{n,t}$.

  ```{math}
  :label: EqStnrzMarkClrBQ
    \hat{BQ}_{t} = \left(\frac{1+r_{p,t}}{1 + \tilde{g}_{n,t}}\right)\left(\sum_{s=E+2}^{E+S+1}\sum_{j=1}^J\rho_{s-1}\lambda_j\hat{\omega}_{s-1,t-1}\hat{b}_{j,s,t}\right) \quad\forall t
  ```
